2. Given the following code, please rewrite generate_list and use_list functions using at least one
different iterator

If I understand the question correctly, we need to use a different iterator and not loop as we usually
do in an iterable object.

Please, check question_2.py to see my implementation. I used generators and the iter() method in order to loop through the
generator.
